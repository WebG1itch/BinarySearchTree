The program itself is pretty simple to run. Simply type 'make' in tesla and it will ask you to define k.
To define k, type a number and press enter. Enter 0 to find the smallest number, and enter 14 to find the largest number.

The program will print out sideways tree. The first line will be the right side and the last line it prints is the left side of the tree.
The program will then print out the k-th smallest number based on the user defined k.

When the program has finished running, you can enter 'make clean' to remove any residual files, like '*.o' files.
